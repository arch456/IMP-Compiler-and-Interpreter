# CSC_502_Final_Project 
The goal of this project is to implement subset of the IMP programming language. Python PLY package will be used to build the lexer and the parser. There are two subgoals: 

1. Develop an interpreter for the IMP language

2. Build a compiler that translates IMP code to Java Bytecode
